World disaster risk visualization.


# Overview
Our website showcases the risk of extreme natural events becoming a disaster from 2011-2021 in 181 countries across the world. Using the data from the World Disaster Risk Dataset we will visualize a world map that will show the World Risk Index on each country by year (user will select the year). A second visualization will be a line graph that will show the World Disaster Risk each year by country (user will select the country).
