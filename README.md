World disaster risk visualization.


# Overview
Our website showcases the risk of extreme natural events becoming a disaster from 2011-2021 in 181 countries across the world. Using the data from the World Disaster Risk Dataset we will visualize the World Risk Index on each country by year. A second visualization will show 5 factors that go into making the World Disaster Risk each year by country. And lastly, we will visualize the World Risk Index category rank out of the 181 countries.
